# FinAI Assistant - Advanced NLP Features

## 🧠 Overview

The FinAI Assistant is powered by a sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine designed specifically for Indian fintech contexts. It understands natural language queries, extracts financial entities, maintains conversation context, and provides personalized insights.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Intent Recognition**
Automatically classifies user queries into 18 different financial intents:

- **Spending Query**: "How much did I spend on food last week?"
- **Income Query**: "What's my monthly income?"
- **Balance Query**: "How much money do I have?"
- **Category Analysis**: "Show my top expense categories"
- **Prediction**: "Forecast next month's expenses"
- **Optimization**: "How can I save money?"
- **Budget Status**: "Am I on track with my budget?"
- **Anomaly Detection**: "Show unusual transactions"
- **Comparison**: "Compare this month vs last month"
- **Goal Tracking**: "How are my financial goals?"
- **Investment Advice**: "Where should I invest?"
- **Loan Recommendation**: "Which loan suits me?"
- **Tax Planning**: "How to save tax?"
- **Credit Score**: "What's my credit score?"
- **Merchant Analysis**: "Where do I spend most?"
- **Transaction Search**: "Find payment to Amazon"
- **Recurring Expenses**: "Show my subscriptions"
- **Savings Challenge**: "Show savings challenges"

### 2. **Entity Extraction**
Intelligently extracts financial entities from queries:

#### Amount Recognition
- Formats: ₹1,25,000, 1.5L, 2 lakh, 1 crore
- Automatic conversion to standard numbers
- Supports Indian number system

#### Time Period Detection
- Natural expressions: "last week", "this month", "yesterday"
- Quarter detection: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4
- Financial year (Apr-Mar): "financial year", "FY"
- Relative dates: "last 7 days", "past 2 weeks"

#### Category Matching
- Fuzzy matching with aliases
- Smart categorization:
  - Food: dining, restaurant, groceries, meals
  - Shopping: clothes, electronics, purchase
  - Travel: cab, taxi, uber, ola, commute
  - Entertainment: movies, games, fun
  - EMI: loan, installment, payment
  - And more...

#### Merchant Recognition
- Detects merchant names from context
- Handles common Indian merchants: Zomato, Swiggy, Amazon, Flipkart, etc.
- Pattern matching for merchant extraction

### 3. **Context Management**
Maintains conversation state for multi-turn conversations:

- **Memory**: Remembers last 5 intents
- **Entity Persistence**: Stores categories, timeframes, amounts
- **Context Inference**: Uses previous context when entities are missing
- **Conversation Tracking**: Knows which turn of conversation

Example:
```
User: "How much did I spend on food?"
AI: [Shows food spending]
User: "What about shopping?"  <- Uses context
AI: [Shows shopping spending automatically]
```

### 4. **Multi-Intent Detection**
Handles complex queries with multiple intents:

```
"Show my food spending and suggest how to reduce it"
-> Intent 1: spending_query (food)
-> Intent 2: optimization
```

### 5. **Sentiment Analysis**
Detects emotional tone:
- **Positive**: "Great!", "Love it"
- **Negative**: "Bad", "Terrible"
- **Concerned**: "Worried", "Help", "Problem"
- **Neutral**: Default tone

Adjusts responses based on sentiment to provide empathetic support.

### 6. **Smart Follow-ups**
Context-aware suggestions after each response:

```
After spending query:
- "How can I reduce this spending?"
- "Compare to last month"
- "Show me the breakdown by merchant"

After budget status:
- "Which category is over budget?"
- "How to optimize my budget?"
- "Show spending trends"
```

### 7. **Clarification Handling**
Asks for clarification when:
- Confidence is low (<50%)
- Required entities are missing
- Query is ambiguous

### 8. **Voice Input Support** 🎤
- Click mic button to start voice input
- Speaks query naturally
- Auto-converts to text
- Works in English and Hindi
