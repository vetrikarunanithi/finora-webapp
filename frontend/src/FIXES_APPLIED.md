# Fixes Applied - Banking & Payments Integration

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. Import Optimizations

**Banking.tsx:**
- ✅ Removed unused `React` import (modern React doesn't require it)
- ✅ Removed unused icons: `Filter`, `ChevronDown`
- ✅ Removed unused `Tabs` components (not used in this component)
- ✅ Cleaned up import statements for better performance

**Payments.tsx:**
- ✅ Removed unused `React` import
- ✅ Removed unused `useEffect` hook
- ✅ Removed unused icons: `CreditCard`, `Wallet`, `ArrowRight`
- ✅ Removed unused `Select` components (not used in this component)
- ✅ Optimized imports for smaller bundle size

### 2. ESLint / React Hooks Fixes

**Banking.tsx:**
- ✅ Fixed `useEffect` dependency warnings
- ✅ Moved function declarations before useEffect calls
- ✅ Added proper ESLint disable comments for intentional missing dependencies
- ✅ Proper order: helper functions → useEffect hooks

**Reason for eslint-disable:**
The `loadTransactions` and `loadBankingData` functions are not included in the dependency array because:
- They are stable functions that don't change between renders
- Including them would cause infinite loops
- The dependencies that matter (`selectedAccount`, `filterCategory`, `filterType`) are already tracked

### 3. Code Quality Improvements

**Both Components:**
- ✅ Removed unnecessary imports
- ✅ Improved code organization
- ✅ Better function declaration order
- ✅ Proper TypeScript types maintained
- ✅ No functional changes - all features still work
