# Banking Payment System Guide

## Overview
The Banking component now features a complete payment system with real-time balance updates, dynamic monthly trend analysis, and AI budget forecasting.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Make Payment Functionality**
- Click "Make Payment" button to open UPI payment dialog
- Fill in:
  - **From Account**: Select source account
  - **Amount**: Enter payment amount (â‚¹)
  - **Recipient Name**: Payee name
  - **UPI ID**: Recipient's UPI ID (e.g., john@paytm)
  - **Category**: Transaction category (Food, Shopping, etc.)

### 2. **Real-Time Balance Updates**
- When payment is successful:
  - Amount is debited from selected account
  - Total balance updates immediately
  - New transaction appears at top of transaction list
  - Balance syncs across Dashboard and Banking pages
  - Data persisted in localStorage

### 3. **Monthly Trend Analysis**
- Dynamic chart showing 7 months of data
- Three metrics tracked:
  - **Income** (Green area)
  - **Expenses** (Orange area)
  - **Savings** (Blue area)
- October data updates based on actual transactions
- Real-time recalculation when payments are made

### 4. **AI Budget Forecast**
- **Avg Monthly Expense**: Calculated from transaction history
- **Projected Savings**: Income minus average expenses
- **Top Expense Category**: Category with highest spending
- **Next Month Forecast**: Predicted expenses with 5% buffer
- **AI Insights**: Personalized recommendations based on spending rate

### 5. **Transaction Management**
- All transactions stored in localStorage
- Filterable by:
  - Account
  - Transaction type (Credit/Debit)
  - Category
- Export functionality ready for CSV download
- Each transaction includes:
  - UPI reference number
  - Category badge with color coding
  - Payment mode (UPI/NEFT/IMPS/Card)
  - Date and time stamp

## Data Flow

### Payment Process:
1. User fills payment form
2. Validates amount and account balance
3. Creates new transaction object
4. Updates account balance (debit)
5. Saves to localStorage
6. Updates UI immediately
7. Shows success toast notification

### Balance Synchronization:
1. Banking component updates localStorage
2. Dashboard polls localStorage every second
3. When change detected, updates display
4. Both components show same balance in real-time

### Monthly Trend Calculation:
- Base historical data (Apr-Sep)
- October data from actual transactions
- Filters transactions by date (10-2025)
- Calculates total expenses for current month
- Updates chart dynamically

### AI Forecast Algorithm:
```javascript
Average Monthly Expense = Total Debits / 3 months
Projected Savings = Monthly Income - Avg Expense
Savings Rate = (Projected Savings / Income) * 100
Next Month Forecast = Avg Expense * 1.05 (5% buffer)
```
