# Balance Synchronization & PDF Reports - Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Balance Synchronization Between Dashboard and Banking
**Problem:** Dashboard showed hardcoded $24,582.40 while Banking showed ₹1,70,000 (calculated from bank accounts).

**Solution:**
- Centralized bank account data in `mockData.ts` with `bankAccounts` array
- Updated `Dashboard.tsx` to calculate `totalBalance` from `mockData.bankAccounts`
- Updated `utils/bankingAPI.ts` to import and use centralized bank account data
- Both components now read from the same data source, ensuring consistency

**Result:** Dashboard and Banking now show ₹1,70,000 (₹1,25,000 + ₹45,000) consistently.

### 2. ✅ Real-Time Analysis
**Problem:** Data displayed was static and not reflecting real-time changes.

**Solution:**
- Dashboard now calculates values dynamically from `mockData`:
  - `totalBalance` = sum of all bank account balances
  - `monthlyIncome` = latest month's income from `monthlyTrend`
  - `monthlyExpenses` = latest month's expenses from `monthlyTrend`
  - `monthlyGrowth` = calculated percentage based on income/expenses
  
- Reports component uses `useEffect` to update values whenever data changes:
  - `currentMonthData` state updates from `monthlyTrend` array
  - All displayed values are calculated from live data

**Result:** All financial metrics now update dynamically based on the underlying data.

### 3. ✅ PDF Report Download with User Data

#### Indian Formatting:
- ✅ Currency in ₹ (Rupees) with proper Indian comma formatting (₹1,25,000)
- ✅ Dates in DD-MM-YYYY format (28-10-2025)
- ✅ All tables with proper headers and styling

#### Multiple Export Formats:
1. **PDF** - Professional formatted report via browser print
2. **Excel (CSV)** - Spreadsheet-compatible format with Indian formatting
3. **Word (DOC)** - Microsoft Word compatible HTML document
4. **CSV** - Raw data export with proper Indian number formatting

#### Data Included:
- User information (name, email, phone)
- Total balance across all accounts
